An android app that automatically square images by extension instead of cropping

Instagram required all images submitted through the mobile app to be in the shape of a square, and their only feature to "squarify" an image is through the process of cropping.
This is not ideal if the photographer want to preserve all aspect of an image.
I have tried to use alternative app such as SnapSeed that allow you to "square" images by adding a black border, but using this app is very time consuming because it take 12 steps to square each images.
My solution made with Android Studio can square images with a single step which improve efficiency by 12x.
For example, if a photographer want to process 10 images, using my app will requires 110 less taps compared to other applications!
